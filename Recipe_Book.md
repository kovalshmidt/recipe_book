### Garlic shrimp with wine and tomatoes

-   **Ingredients** : 3-4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced; 1 shallot, finley diced; a small knob of butter; 1 tbsp olive oil; 16 medium-sized shrimps; 200 ml white wine; 1 tbsp sugar

-   **Instructions** : Heat up a pan and melt the knob of butter in some olive oil. Add one of the garlic cloves and the shrimps and saute them one minute per side. Set the shrimps aside and add the shallot and other garlic cloves. Cook for a few minutes until fragrant (but not coloured) and add the wine to deglaze the pan. After a few minutes, add the tomato passata and cook for 5-10 minutes. Just before finishing cooking, add back the shrimps and the thyme. You could add a dash of extra white wine if the sauce is too thick.
