Preheat your oven to 200°c *ignore what I said in the video!* , add 1 teaspoon of dripping and sunflower oil to each hole (these are large Yorkshire puddings, for a smaller tray use 1 tsp). Place in the preheated oven until smoking hot (20 mins), then add your batter to the tray, fill 1/3 of the way. bake in the centre of your oven for 20 mins, flip and bake for 5 more mins. If you find the bottoms aren’t done, drop the temp to 150°c and let em cook for a few extra mins

### How to cook steak – the cheffy way!

- **Ingredients**: 

Thickish cut steak – no more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, because we want to cook this entirely on the stove (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven). Ideal steaks: boneless rib eye / scotch fillet, porterhouse / New York, T-bone. Grade: takes high quality steak over the top amazing, really elevates economical steak.

Butter, garlic and fresh thyme

- **Instructions**:
Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order 
for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;

Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;

Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for the crust

WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!

Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and

REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!

Or, roast on a sheet pan in a 450°F, turning until charred on all sides (about 15 minutes). Transfer the charred pepper to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Set aside for 10 minutes while you work on other things. When the pepper has cooled enough to handle, peel the charred skin off and coarsely chop into bite sized pieces. Mix: In a medium salad bowl, add the pepper, tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, and shallot. Sprinkle with a big pinch of kosher salt. Add the vinegar and a good drizzle of olive oil (about 2 tablespoons). Toss to combine. Finish: Transfer the salad to a serving platter. Top with feta cheese and olives. Serve.
