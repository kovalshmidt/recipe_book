- **Instructions**: Place the fish, garlic, and egg in the large bowl of a food processor with 1 tsp of the cumin seeds, 1 tsp of the lime zest, and ¾ tsp salt. Blitz briefly, just until the fish forms a coarse paste, then transfer to a medium bowl. Add ½ cup of the cilantro, mix, then form into 12 round fish cakes, each weighing about 1½ oz/45g. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes (and up to 1 day ahead), to firm up. Put the yogurt, the remaining ½ tsp of the cumin seeds, the remaining lime zest, and ⅛ tsp salt into a small bowl. Mix together and set aside. In a separate small bowl, combine the onion, mango, and chile and set aside. Heat the oil in a large nonstick frying pan and place over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the fish cakes in batches and fry for 2–3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate.
