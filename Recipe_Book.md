###How to cook steak – the cheffy way!

- **Ingredients**: 

Thickish cut steak – no more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, because we want to cook this entirely on the stove (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven). Ideal steaks: boneless rib eye / scotch fillet, porterhouse / New York, T-bone. Grade: takes high quality steak over the top amazing, really elevates economical steak.

Butter, garlic and fresh thyme

- **Instructions**:
Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order 
for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;

Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;

Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for the crust

WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!

Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and

REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!
