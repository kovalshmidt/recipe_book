### Garlic shrimp with wine and tomatoes

- **Ingredients** : 3-4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced; 1 shallot, finley diced; a small knob of butter; 1 tbsp olive oil; 16 medium-sized shrimps; 200 ml white wine; 1 tbsp sugar

- **Instructions** : Heat up a pan and melt the knob of butter in some olive oil. Add one of the garlic cloves and the shrimps and saute them one minute per side. Set the shrimps aside and add the shallot and other garlic cloves. Cook for a few minutes until fragrant (but not coloured) and add the wine to deglaze the pan. After a few minutes, add the tomato passata and cook for 5-10 minutes. Just before finishing cooking, add back the shrimps and the thyme. You could add a dash of extra white wine if the sauce is too thick.

### Fish cake tacos with mango, lime and cumin yogurt

- **Ingredients**: 15¾ oz/450g plaice fillets (or a similar white fish), skin and pinbones removed, cut into ¾–1¼-inch/2–3cm chunks; 1 garlic clove, crushed; 1 large egg; 1½ tsp cumin seeds, toasted and finely crushed in a pestle and mortar; 4 limes: finely zest to get 1 tbsp, then cut into wedges, to serve; salt; 1 cup/20g cilantro leaves, finely chopped; ½ cup/120g Greek-style yogurt; ½ red onion, thinly sliced (½ cup/40g); ½ mango, peeled and julienned (½ cup/100g); 1 red chile, seeded and julienned (1 tbsp); 3 tbsp vegetable oil; 12 (6-inch/15cm) corn or flour tortillas, warmed through;

- **Instructions**: Place the fish, garlic, and egg in the large bowl of a food processor with 1 tsp of the cumin seeds, 1 tsp of the lime zest, and ¾ tsp salt. Blitz briefly, just until the fish forms a coarse paste, then transfer to a medium bowl. Add ½ cup of the cilantro, mix, then form into 12 round fish cakes, each weighing about 1½ oz/45g. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes (and up to 1 day ahead), to firm up. Put the yogurt, the remaining ½ tsp of the cumin seeds, the remaining lime zest, and ⅛ tsp salt into a small bowl. Mix together and set aside. In a separate small bowl, combine the onion, mango, and chile and set aside. Heat the oil in a large nonstick frying pan and place over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the fish cakes in batches and fry for 2–3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate. Serve each taco warm, with 1 fish cake, cut in half, a spoonful of yogurt, and the mango mix. Finish with a sprinkle of the remaining ½ cup of cilantro and a squeeze of lime.
